TLS Certificate Issue Resolution Plan
Problem Statement
Devices are failing to establish secure connections with the error: TLS handshake failed - this may be due to certificate issues, incompatible TLS versions, or network problems: remote error: tls: unknown certificate
Immediate Actions (Hours)
Certificate Regeneration
Stop Syncthing service
Delete existing certificate files (cert.pem and key.pem)
Restart Syncthing to regenerate new certificates
Ensure proper file permissions (0600 for key file)
Device Configuration Reset
Clear device identities from configuration
Re-add devices with new certificate information
Exchange new device IDs between peers
Network Configuration Check
Verify firewall rules allow TCP port 22000
Check NAT traversal settings
Ensure consistent network addressing
Short-term Improvements (Days)
Enhanced Error Reporting
Add detailed logging for certificate loading process
Implement specific error messages for different TLS failure types
Add certificate validation checks with improved error reporting
DowngradingListener Improvements
Enhanced error diagnostics for the DowngradingListener
Add detailed logging for TLS detection and handshake processes
Improve error handling for mixed TLS/non-TLS connections
Long-term Enhancements (Weeks)
Certificate Lifecycle Management
Automatic certificate renewal before expiration
Certificate revocation support
Backup/restore functionality for certificates
Improved Validation
Certificate pinning support
Enhanced device identity verification
Integration with external CA systems
Monitoring and Alerting
Certificate expiration alerts
Connection quality metrics
Automated failure detection
Testing Strategy
Unit Tests
Certificate generation with various parameters
TLS handshake simulation with failure scenarios
Certificate validation logic testing
Integration Tests
Successful connections between devices
Certificate mismatch scenarios
Certificate renewal processes
Rollback Plan
If issues occur:
Revert to previous certificate files
Restore device configuration from backup
Disable new certificate validation features
This plan addresses the immediate TLS certificate issue while providing long-term improvements for certificate management in Syncthing.
