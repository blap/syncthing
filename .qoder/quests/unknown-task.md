Syncthing Folder Path Validation Enhancement Plan
1. Problem Identification
The issue "as pastas não estão sendo encontradas" (folders are not being found) occurs when Syncthing cannot access configured folder paths. This can happen due to:
Path does not exist
Insufficient permissions
Missing .stfolder marker
Network drive issues
Symbolic link problems
2. Current Implementation Analysis
From examining the codebase, I found:
2.1 Key Components
lib/config/folderconfiguration.go - Contains folder validation logic
lib/model/model.go - Manages folder lifecycle and health checks
Error types: ErrPathMissing, ErrPathNotDirectory, ErrMarkerMissing
2.2 Current Validation Flow
Folder config loaded from XML
CheckPath() validates folder accessibility during initialization
Health checks performed periodically
Errors reported through API and GUI
