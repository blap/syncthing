# SSL Handshake Error Analysis and Resolution Design

## 1. Overview

This document analyzes the SSL handshake error occurring in Syncthing's GUI/API interface, specifically the error: "A negociação de SSL falhou: Falha no handshake:Um token interno era inválido" (SSL negotiation failed: Handshake failure: An internal token was invalid). This error prevents access to the REST API endpoints at `https://127.0.0.1:8384/rest/system/connections` and `https://127.0.0.1:8384/rest/system/error`. Additionally, folders are not being found or scanned, which may be contributing to or related to the SSL handshake issues.

## 2. Problem Analysis

### 2.1 Error Details
- **Error Message**: "A negociação de SSL falhou: Falha no handshake:Um token interno era inválido"
- **Affected Endpoints**: 
  - `https://127.0.0.1:8384/rest/system/connections`
  - `https://127.0.0.1:8384/rest/system/error`
- **Context**: The error occurs when trying to access the Syncthing GUI/API over HTTPS

### 2.2 System Information from Logs
- Syncthing version: v2.0.6 "Beryllium Bedbug"
- Build information: go1.25.1 windows-amd64
- GUI/API listening on: 127.0.0.1:8384
- TLS configuration in use

### 2.3 Root Cause Analysis

Based on the code analysis, the SSL handshake error is likely caused by one of the following issues:

1. **Certificate Validation Failure**: The HTTPS certificate used by the GUI/API may be corrupted, expired, or incompatible
2. **TLS Configuration Issues**: Problems with the TLS configuration or cipher suites
3. **Certificate Regeneration Problems**: Issues with the automatic certificate regeneration process
4. **Platform-Specific Issues**: Windows-specific TLS handling problems
5. **DowngradingListener Issues**: Problems with the TLS detection mechanism that handles both TLS and non-TLS connections
6. **System Time Issues**: Incorrect system time causing certificate validation failures
7. **Folder Scanning Issues**: Problems with folder scanning that may be related to or causing SSL handshake failures
8. **Resource Exhaustion**: High resource consumption from folder scanning operations affecting SSL connection handling
9. **Folder Discovery Issues**: Folders not being found or properly indexed, potentially affecting the system's ability to serve API requests

## 3. Current SSL/TLS Implementation

### 3.1 Certificate Management
Syncthing uses self-signed certificates for GUI/API access:
- Certificates are automatically generated at first run
- Stored in: `locations.Get(locations.HTTPSCertFile)` and `locations.Get(locations.HTTPSKeyFile)`
- Uses ECDSA-P256 keys for browser compatibility
- Certificates are regenerated if expired or expiring within 30 days

### 3.2 TLS Configuration
- Uses `tlsutil.SecureDefaultWithTLS12()` configuration
- Supports TLS 1.2 as minimum version
- Uses secure cipher suites prioritized for performance

### 3.3 DowngradingListener Implementation
Syncthing uses a `DowngradingListener` to handle both TLS and non-TLS connections on the same port:
- Detects TLS connections by checking for the TLS handshake byte (0x16)
- Wraps TLS connections with `tls.Server()`
- Passes non-TLS connections through directly

### 3.4 Certificate Loading Process

    J --> K[Create listener with DowngradingListener]
    K --> L[Start serving HTTPS requests]
```

### 3.5 Folder Scanning and Resource Usage

Syncthing uses a concurrency limiting mechanism for folder operations to prevent resource exhaustion:

1. **MaxFolderConcurrency**: Controls how many folders may concurrently be in I/O-intensive operations such as syncing or scanning
   - Default value: Number of logical CPU cores in the system
   - Can be configured to limit concurrent operations
   - When set to 0, defaults to the number of logical CPUs
   - When set to a negative value, removes all limits

2. **Resource Exhaustion Impact on SSL**: 
   - High CPU or memory usage from intensive folder scanning can affect SSL connection handling
   - I/O bottlenecks from scanning operations can delay SSL handshake processing
   - Semaphore-based limiting mechanism can cause delays in SSL connection establishment when resources are constrained

3. **Folder Discovery Issues**:
   - Folders may not be properly indexed or found in the filesystem
   - Filesystem permissions issues may prevent folder scanning
   - Path resolution problems may cause folders to appear missing
   - Configuration errors in folder definitions may prevent proper scanning
   - Issues with the folder state management system may cause scanning to fail

## 4. Solution Design

### 4.1 Immediate Fixes
