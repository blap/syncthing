# Bandwidth Aggregation Research

This document captures the research findings on bandwidth aggregation techniques and requirements for implementation in Syncthing.

## Overview

Bandwidth aggregation is the process of combining multiple network connections to increase total available bandwidth and improve reliability. In the context of Syncthing, this could mean utilizing multiple connections to the same device simultaneously to increase transfer speeds and provide redundancy.

## Existing Bandwidth Aggregation Techniques

### 1. Link Aggregation (Link Bonding)
- Combines multiple network interfaces at the data link layer
- Commonly used in enterprise networks with switches that support link aggregation
- Protocols: LACP (Link Aggregation Control Protocol)
- Benefits: Increased bandwidth, redundancy, load balancing
- Limitations: Requires compatible network hardware

### 2. Multipath TCP (MPTCP)
- Extension to traditional TCP that allows a single TCP connection to use multiple paths
- Implemented at the transport layer
- Benefits: Transparent to applications, automatic failover
- Limitations: Requires OS and network support, not widely adopted

### 3. Application-Level Multipath
- Implemented at the application layer
- Applications manage multiple connections independently
- Benefits: Works with existing network infrastructure, flexible implementation
- Limitations: More complex to implement, requires application support

## Requirements for Syncthing

### 1. Connection Discovery
- Identify when multiple paths to the same device are available
- Detect connection quality and bandwidth capacity for each path
- Monitor connection status in real-time

### 2. Load Distribution
- Distribute data across multiple connections effectively
- Consider connection quality when distributing load
- Adapt to changing network conditions

### 3. Failover and Redundancy
- Automatically switch to alternative paths when connections fail
- Preserve transfer state during failover
- Minimize disruption to ongoing transfers

### 4. Bandwidth Measurement
- Accurately measure bandwidth of each connection
- Track real-time throughput for each path
- Aggregate bandwidth metrics across all connections

## Challenges and Considerations

### 1. Connection Heterogeneity
- Different connection types (LAN, WAN, relay) with varying characteristics
- Different bandwidth capacities and latency profiles
- Need for adaptive algorithms to handle diverse connection qualities

### 2. Synchronization
- Ensuring data consistency across multiple connections
- Coordinating transfer state between connections
- Handling out-of-order packet delivery

### 3. Resource Management
- Efficiently utilizing system resources (CPU, memory, network)
- Preventing resource exhaustion with many connections
- Balancing resource usage with performance gains

### 4. Compatibility
- Maintaining compatibility with existing Syncthing devices
- Ensuring graceful degradation when bandwidth aggregation is not supported
- Supporting mixed environments with devices of different capabilities

## Implementation Approach for Syncthing

### 1. Leverage Existing Multipath Infrastructure
- Build upon the existing PacketScheduler and multipath connection support
- Extend current connection management to support bandwidth aggregation
- Utilize existing health monitoring for connection quality assessment

### 2. Chunk-Based Distribution
- Distribute file transfers across connections in chunks
- Use connection quality metrics to determine chunk distribution
- Implement adaptive chunk sizing based on connection characteristics

### 3. Real-Time Monitoring
- Continuously monitor bandwidth and latency of each connection
- Adjust distribution strategy based on real-time metrics
- Implement feedback mechanisms to optimize performance

### 4. Configuration Options
- Provide user-configurable settings for bandwidth aggregation
- Allow users to enable/disable the feature
- Support different aggregation strategies (performance vs. reliability)

## Similar Implementations

### 1. BitTorrent
- Uses multiple connections to different peers simultaneously
- Implements choking/unchoking algorithms to manage connections
- Dynamically adjusts connection usage based on performance

### 2. HTTP/2 and HTTP/3
- Support multiple concurrent streams over a single connection
- Implement connection pooling for efficient resource usage
- Use flow control to manage data transfer rates

### 3. Enterprise Network Bonding
- Link aggregation in network switches and routers
- Load balancing across multiple network interfaces
- Automatic failover and redundancy mechanisms

## Next Steps

1. Design detailed architecture for bandwidth aggregation in Syncthing
2. Create unit tests for bandwidth measurement and aggregation logic
3. Implement bandwidth measurement capabilities
4. Develop algorithms for load distribution and optimization
5. Test with various network scenarios and connection types
