# Android Project Upgrade Summary

This document summarizes the changes made to upgrade the Android project to use more recent versions of Gradle and related tools.

## Changes Made

### Gradle Wrapper
- Updated from Gradle 8.5 to 8.7
- File: `gradle/wrapper/gradle-wrapper.properties`

### Android Gradle Plugin
- Updated from version 8.2.0 to 8.5.0
- File: `build.gradle` (project level)

### Kotlin Version
- Updated from 1.9.0 to 1.9.10
- File: `build.gradle` (project level)

### Gradle Properties
- Added `android.disableJdkImageTransform=true` to avoid JDK image transformation issues
- File: `gradle.properties`

## Build Status
The project now builds successfully with the updated versions. The APK is generated without errors.

## Compatibility Notes
- Gradle 9.0.0 is not yet fully compatible with the Android Gradle Plugin
- Using Gradle 8.7 with AGP 8.5.0 provides a stable and up-to-date configuration
- The `android.disableJdkImageTransform=true` property is used to avoid issues with JDK image transformation in newer Android SDK versions

## Future Considerations
- Monitor for future releases of the Android Gradle Plugin that may support Gradle 9.0.0
- Consider updating to newer versions as they become stable and compatible
