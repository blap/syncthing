# Syncthing Connection Enhancement Implementation Plan

## Overview

This document details the implementation plan for Syncthing connection enhancements to improve connection reliability and stability. Based on user feedback about connection issues, we will implement adaptive connection management features following the Test-Driven Development (TDD) approach with comprehensive testing before implementation.

## Current Implementation Status

### Completed Analysis

- [x] Analyzed existing connection management code in `lib/connections/` and `lib/protocol/`
- [x] Identified limitations in current health monitoring
- [x] Reviewed existing HealthMonitor implementation in `lib/connections/health_monitor.go`
- [x] Documented connection issues based on user feedback

## Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Enhanced Health Monitoring System

#### Testing First (TDD Approach)

- [ ] Create unit tests for health score calculation accuracy
- [ ] Implement tests for adaptive interval adjustments
- [ ] Add integration tests for health monitor metrics collection

#### Implementation

1. **Enhance HealthMonitor (`lib/connections/health_monitor.go`)**:
   - [ ] Add methods to record latency samples: `RecordLatency(latency time.Duration)`
   - [ ] Add methods to record packet loss: `RecordPacketLoss(lossRate float64)`
   - [ ] Implement health score calculation: `GetHealthScore()`
   - [ ] Add adaptive interval calculation: `GetInterval()`
   - [ ] Add configuration options for min/max intervals

2. **Update Connection Tracker (`lib/connections/service.go`)**:
   - [ ] Modify `addLatencySample` to also update health monitor
   - [ ] Add packet loss tracking to connection statistics
   - [ ] Integrate health monitor with connection management

#### Implementation Details

1. **HealthMonitor Enhancement (`lib/connections/health_monitor.go`)**:
   - Add `latencySamples []time.Duration` field to store recent latency measurements
   - Add `packetLossSamples []float64` field to store recent packet loss measurements
   - Implement `RecordLatency(latency time.Duration)` method to:
     - Add latency to `latencySamples` slice
     - Maintain only last 10 samples
     - Update current latency value
     - Call `updateJitter()` and `updateHealthScore()`
   - Implement `RecordPacketLoss(lossRate float64)` method to:
     - Add loss rate to `packetLossSamples` slice
     - Maintain only last 10 samples
     - Update current packet loss value
     - Call `updateHealthScore()`
   - Enhance `GetHealthScore()` method to calculate weighted score:
     - Normalize latency (0-1 scale, lower latency = higher score)
     - Normalize packet loss (0-1 scale, lower loss = higher score)
     - Calculate weighted score: latency (50%) + packet loss (20%)
     - Return score as 0-100 value
   - Update `GetInterval()` method to use quadratic mapping:
     - Map health score (0-100) to interval (minInterval to maxInterval)
     - Use formula: `interval = min + (max-min) * (healthScore/100)^2`
     - Ensure interval stays within bounds

2. **Connection Tracker Updates (`lib/connections/service.go`)**:
   - Modify `connectionStat` struct to add `packetLoss float64` field
   - Update `addLatencySample` method to call `healthMonitor.RecordLatency()`
   - Add packet loss calculation based on successful vs failed pings
   - Integrate health monitor with connection management logic

       normalizedLatency := hm.normalizeLatency()
       normalizedPacketLoss := hm.normalizePacketLoss()
       
       // Weighted calculation: Latency (50%), Packet Loss (20%)
       healthScore := (normalizedLatency * 0.5) + (normalizedPacketLoss * 0.2)
       return healthScore * 100 // Convert to 0-100 scale
   }

   func (hm *healthMonitor) GetInterval() time.Duration {
       score := hm.GetHealthScore()
       
       opts := hm.cfg.Options()
       minInterval := time.Duration(opts.AdaptiveKeepAliveMinS) * time.Second
       maxInterval := time.Duration(opts.AdaptiveKeepAliveMaxS) * time.Second
       
       // Adaptive intervals based on health score
       switch {
       case score >= 80: // Excellent
           return maxInterval
       case score >= 60: // Good
           return maxInterval / 2
       case score >= 40: // Fair
           return maxInterval / 4

       // Start with default interval
       interval := PingSendInterval
       
       // Check if we have a health monitor with adaptive intervals
       if c.healthMonitor != nil && c.cfg.Options().AdaptiveKeepAliveEnabled {
           interval = c.healthMonitor.GetInterval()
       }
       
       ticker := time.NewTicker(interval / 2)
       defer ticker.Stop()
       
       for {
           select {
           case <-ticker.C:

## Deployment and Rollout

### Phased Rollout Strategy
1. **Phase 1**: Release health monitoring enhancements
   - Deploy enhanced health monitoring as opt-in feature
   - Monitor metrics and user feedback
   - Address any performance issues

2. **Phase 2**: Release adaptive keep-alive mechanism
   - Enable adaptive keep-alive for select users
   - Validate interval adjustments work correctly
   - Optimize health score calculations

3. **Phase 3**: Release intelligent reconnection logic
   - Deploy reconnection improvements to subset of users
   - Monitor reconnection success rates
   - Fine-tune backoff and jitter parameters

4. **Phase 4**: Release NAT PMP and Local Discovery enhancements
   - Deploy improved NAT traversal mechanisms
   - Enable enhanced local discovery features
   - Monitor connection establishment success rates

5. **Phase 5**: Full release
   - Enable all features by default
   - Provide configuration options for customization
   - Update documentation and user guides

### Backward Compatibility
- All new features will be disabled by default initially
- Existing connection behavior will be preserved when features are disabled
- Configuration options will allow users to revert to previous behavior
- API compatibility will be maintained for external integrations

## Conclusion

This implementation plan provides a structured approach to enhancing Syncthing's connection management capabilities. By following the Test-Driven Development approach and implementing features in phases, we can ensure robust, well-tested improvements to connection reliability and stability.

The TODO list provides a clear roadmap for implementation, with priorities assigned to each task. The enhancements will maintain backward compatibility while providing significant improvements in connection management for users experiencing network issues.
