# Syncthing Connection Stability Fixes for v2.x Versions

This document summarizes the fixes implemented to address connection stability issues between Syncthing v2.x versions, as documented in the analysis.

## Issues Addressed

1. **Memory Usage Calculation Errors**: Fixed incorrect memory usage reporting that was causing false high memory usage warnings
2. **HTTP/2 Protocol Issues**: Added fallback mechanism from HTTP/2 to HTTP/1.1 for crash reporting
3. **Filesystem Watcher Issues on Android**: Improved logging and buffer management for inotify on Android devices
4. **NAT-PMP Implementation Issues**: Added retry mechanisms with exponential backoff for NAT-PMP operations

## Changes Made

### 1. Memory Usage Calculation Fix (`lib/model/folder_health_monitor.go`)

**Problem**: The memory usage calculation was not properly handling errors from `mem.VirtualMemory()` calls, leading to extremely high memory usage values being reported (near maximum uint64 values ~18EB).

**Solution**:
- Added proper error handling for `mem.VirtualMemory()` calls
- Implemented sanity checks to prevent extremely high memory usage values from being reported
- Fixed the calculation logic to properly handle cases where initial memory stats are unavailable

### 2. HTTP/2 Compatibility Improvements (`lib/ur/failurereporting.go`)

**Problem**: Malformed HTTP responses with binary data suggesting HTTP/2 protocol issues were causing crash reporting failures.

**Solution**:
- Enhanced HTTP client configuration with better HTTP/2 compatibility settings
- Added fallback mechanism from HTTP/2 to HTTP/1.1 when HTTP/2 errors are detected
- Added detailed logging for HTTP/2 specific errors to aid in debugging
- Added user agent header for better server identification

### 3. Android Filesystem Watcher Improvements (`lib/fs/basicfs_watch_android.go`)

**Problem**: Repeated failures to start the filesystem watcher on Android due to inotify limits and insufficient logging.

**Solution**:
- Added detailed error logging for inotify failures
- Improved buffer management with better adaptive sizing
- Added comprehensive logging throughout the watcher lifecycle
- Enhanced error reporting for different types of filesystem watcher failures

### 4. NAT-PMP Implementation Fixes (`lib/pmp/pmp.go`)

**Problem**: "Connection refused" errors in NAT-PMP port mapping suggesting issues with the NAT-PMP implementation or router compatibility.

**Solution**:
- Added retry mechanisms with exponential backoff for NAT-PMP operations
- Implemented better error handling and logging for NAT-PMP failures
- Added specific handling for "connection refused" errors
- Enhanced timeout handling for NAT-PMP requests

## Testing Recommendations

1. **Memory Usage Monitoring**: Monitor memory usage reports to ensure the fixes prevent false high memory usage warnings
2. **HTTP/2 Compatibility**: Test crash reporting functionality with both HTTP/1.1 and HTTP/2 endpoints
3. **Android Filesystem Watching**: Test on various Android devices with different inotify limits
4. **NAT-PMP Functionality**: Test port mapping on different router firmware versions

## Expected Outcomes

These fixes should resolve the connection stability issues between Syncthing v2.x instances by:

1. Eliminating false memory usage warnings that were causing unnecessary throttling
2. Ensuring reliable crash reporting through HTTP/2 fallback mechanisms
3. Improving filesystem monitoring stability on Android devices
4. Enhancing NAT-PMP compatibility with various router implementations

The fixes maintain backward compatibility with v1.x instances while improving v2.x to v2.x connection stability.
