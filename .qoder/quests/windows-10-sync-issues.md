# Windows 10 Sync Issues Affecting Syncthing Connections

## 1. Overview

This document analyzes potential Windows 10 updates and system configurations that may affect Syncthing's network connections and synchronization performance. Based on community reports and technical analysis, several Windows 10 features and updates have been identified as potentially causing connection issues with Syncthing. The document focuses on code-level improvements for enhancing connection reliability in various Windows scenarios.

## 2. Windows 10 Updates Affecting Network Connections

### 2.1 KB5060998 Update

A specific Windows 10 update (KB5060998) has been reported to consistently break Syncthing's network access. Users have reported that after installing this update, Syncthing experiences connection problems that require blocking the update to resolve.

### 2.2 General Windows Update Impact

Windows 10 monthly updates can affect network connectivity for applications like Syncthing. These updates may change:
- Network stack behavior
- Firewall rules
- Power management settings
- Port reservation mechanisms

## 3. Code-Level Improvements for Connection Reliability

### 3.1 Adaptive Connection Timeouts

The current Syncthing codebase uses fixed timeout values that may not be optimal for all Windows network conditions:

1. **TLS Handshake Timeout**: Currently fixed at 10 seconds (`tlsHandshakeTimeout`). This should be made adaptive based on network conditions.
2. **Connection Loop Sleep**: Currently fixed at 5 seconds minimum (`minConnectionLoopSleep`) and 1 minute standard (`stdConnectionLoopSleep`). These should be adjusted based on connection success rates.
3. **Dial Timeout**: Implement adaptive dial timeouts that increase progressively for problematic connections.

### 3.2 Windows-Specific Connection Handling

1. **Network Adapter State Monitoring**: Implement detection of network adapter power state changes and automatically trigger reconnection when adapters wake up.
2. **Interface Change Detection**: Add Windows-specific network interface change monitoring to detect when network profiles change from Public to Private.
3. **Connection Resilience**: Implement more aggressive reconnection strategies for Windows environments where connections are more likely to be dropped.

### 3.3 Improved Error Handling and Retry Logic

1. **Specific Windows Error Detection**: Add detection for Windows-specific network errors and implement targeted retry strategies.
2. **Exponential Backoff with Jitter**: Implement more sophisticated backoff algorithms for connection retries on Windows.
3. **Connection Health Monitoring**: Add proactive connection health checks that can detect degraded connections before they fail completely.

### 3.4 Multipath Connection Support

1. **Multiple Connection Paths**: Implement support for maintaining multiple simultaneous connections to the same device over different network interfaces.
2. **Automatic Failover**: Add automatic failover mechanisms when primary connections degrade or fail.
3. **Load Balancing**: Implement load balancing across multiple connections for improved throughput.
