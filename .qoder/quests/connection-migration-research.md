# Connection Migration During Active Transfers - Research Document

## Overview

This document analyzes the requirements for implementing connection migration during active transfers in Syncthing. Connection migration refers to the ability to seamlessly switch from one active connection to another without interrupting ongoing file transfers.

## Current Transfer Mechanism in Syncthing

### File Transfer Process
1. Files are divided into blocks for transfer
2. Blocks are requested and sent between devices using the BEP (Block Exchange Protocol)
3. Transfer state is maintained in memory during the transfer process
4. If a connection is lost, the transfer must be restarted from the beginning or from a checkpoint

### Connection Handling
1. Each device maintains one or more connections to peers
2. When using multipath connections, traffic can be distributed across multiple connections
3. Connection failures trigger reconnection attempts through the connection service
4. There is no built-in mechanism for migrating active transfers between connections

## Requirements for Connection Migration

### Functional Requirements
1. **Seamless Transfer Migration**: Active transfers should continue without interruption when migrating between connections
2. **State Preservation**: Transfer state must be preserved during migration, including:
   - Blocks already transferred
   - Blocks in progress
   - Transfer progress tracking
3. **Migration Triggers**: Migration should be triggered based on:
   - Connection quality degradation
   - Connection failure detection
   - Bandwidth optimization opportunities
4. **Graceful Degradation**: If migration fails, the system should fall back to existing reconnection mechanisms

### Non-Functional Requirements
1. **Performance**: Migration should not significantly impact transfer throughput
2. **Resource Usage**: Migration should not consume excessive memory or CPU resources
3. **Compatibility**: Migration should work with existing Syncthing versions (backward compatibility)
4. **Security**: Migration should not compromise the security of transferred data

## Technical Challenges

### State Synchronization
- Ensuring both ends of the transfer have consistent state during migration
- Coordinating the handover between old and new connections
- Handling race conditions during the migration process

### Protocol Considerations
- Extending the BEP to support migration signaling
- Ensuring both devices support migration capabilities
- Handling cases where one device supports migration and the other doesn't

### Error Handling
- Handling migration failures gracefully
- Rolling back to the original connection if migration fails
- Managing partial transfer states

## Potential Solutions

### Approach 1: Application-Level Migration
- Implement migration logic at the Syncthing application layer
- Use existing protocol messages to coordinate migration
- Preserve transfer state in memory and transfer it to the new connection

### Approach 2: Protocol-Level Migration
- Extend the BEP with migration-specific messages
- Implement migration as a core protocol feature
- Provide standardized migration handshake between devices

### Approach 3: Hybrid Approach
- Combine application-level and protocol-level techniques
- Use lightweight protocol extensions for coordination
- Implement complex logic at the application layer

## Implementation Considerations

### Connection Quality Monitoring
- Monitor connection metrics to determine when migration is beneficial
- Consider latency, bandwidth, and packet loss in migration decisions
- Implement adaptive migration thresholds

### Transfer State Management
- Design data structures to represent transfer state
- Implement serialization/deserialization for state transfer
- Ensure atomic state transitions during migration

### Coordination Mechanisms
- Implement handshake protocols for migration coordination
- Handle concurrent migration attempts
- Manage migration timeouts and retries

## Similar Implementations

### HTTP/2 Connection Migration
- Supports connection migration through stream multiplexing
- Uses stream identifiers to maintain context across connections

### QUIC Protocol
- Built-in connection migration support
- Uses connection IDs to maintain session continuity
- Handles address changes transparently

### WebRTC
- Implements ICE (Interactive Connectivity Establishment) for connection migration
- Supports multiple connection candidates simultaneously

## Recommendations

1. **Start with Application-Level Implementation**: Begin with an application-level solution that can be implemented without protocol changes
2. **Focus on Common Use Cases**: Prioritize migration scenarios that provide the most user benefit
3. **Implement Gradual Migration**: Allow partial migration of transfers rather than requiring all-or-nothing migration
4. **Ensure Backward Compatibility**: Design the solution to work gracefully with older Syncthing versions

## Next Steps

1. Create detailed technical specifications for the migration mechanism
2. Design data structures for transfer state representation
3. Implement proof-of-concept migration functionality
4. Create comprehensive test cases for migration scenarios
