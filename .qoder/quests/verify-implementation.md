# Syncthing Implementation Verification

## 1. Overview

This document verifies the implementation status of Syncthing components based on the log analysis from "2025-09-06-085147-inf-saved-log-output-pathdsyncthingtray....md". The verification focuses on core components that were active in the log output, including certificate management, folder synchronization, connection management, and discovery mechanisms.

## 2. Architecture

Syncthing follows a peer-to-peer (P2P) distributed architecture where each node acts as both client and server. The system uses a modular monolith design in Go, with distinct components for networking, configuration, file scanning, and synchronization logic.
