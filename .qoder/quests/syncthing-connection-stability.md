# Syncthing Connection Stability Analysis Between v2.x Versions

## Document Status: Analysis Complete

## 1. Overview

This document analyzes connection stability issues between Syncthing v2.x versions, specifically addressing the problem where connections are stable between v1.x and v2.x but unstable between v2.x and v2.x instances. The analysis is based on provided logs showing memory usage warnings, connection failures, crash reporting issues, and additional logs showing filesystem watcher and NAT traversal problems.

## 2. Problem Statement

Based on the user's report:
1. Connections are stable between Syncthing v1.x and v2.x versions
2. Connections are unstable between Syncthing v2.x and v2.x versions
3. Logs show extensive memory usage warnings across all folders
4. Crash reporting to `https://crash.syncthing.net/newcrash/failure` is failing with malformed HTTP responses and EOF errors
5. Filesystem watcher is failing with inotify limits on Android
6. NAT-PMP port mapping is failing with "connection refused" errors

The user is running Syncthing v2.0.9-dev.34.g2ee75a0e.dirty on Windows with Go 1.25.1, connecting to other v2.x instances with connection instability issues. Additional logs show a v2.0.8 instance running on Android ARM64 with similar issues.

## 3. Log Analysis

### 3.1 Memory Usage Issues
The logs show repeated warnings about high memory usage for all folders:
```
WRN High memory usage detected for folder, throttling may be needed (folder=2cuhx-wiqrs memoryBytes=18446744073709543424 maxAllowedMB=1024 log.pkg=model)
```

The memory usage values appear to be extremely high (near maximum uint64 values ~18EB), suggesting a potential integer overflow or memory tracking issue in v2.x. This value is suspiciously close to the maximum value of a 64-bit unsigned integer (18446744073709551615), indicating either:
1. A counter overflow where negative values are being interpreted as unsigned
2. An issue with memory statistics collection
3. A bug in the memory usage calculation or reporting

### 3.2 Crash Reporting Failures
Multiple failures to send crash reports:
```
WRN Failed to send failure report (error="Post \"https://crash.syncthing.net/newcrash/failure\": net/http: HTTP/1.x transport connection broken: malformed HTTP response \"\\x00\\x00\\x1e\\x04\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x05\\x00\\x10\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x03\\x00\\x00\\x00\\fa\\x00\\x06\\x00\\x10\\x01@\\x00\\x01\\x00\\x00\\x10\\x00\\x00\\x04\\x00\\x10\\x00\\x00\"" log.pkg=ur)
WRN Failed to send failure report (error="Post \"https://crash.syncthing.net/newcrash/failure\": EOF" log.pkg=ur)
```

The malformed HTTP responses with binary data suggest HTTP/2 protocol issues. The hex sequence `\x00\x00\x1e\x04` is characteristic of HTTP/2 frame headers, indicating that the client is attempting to use HTTP/2 but the server response is malformed or incompatible.

### 3.3 NAT and Connection Information
The logs show successful NAT traversal and relay connection:
```
INF Detected NAT type (uri=quic://0.0.0.0:22000 type="Port restricted NAT" log.pkg=connections)
INF Resolved external address (uri=quic://0.0.0.0:22000 address=quic://191.122.236.23:1033 via=stun.voip.aebc.com:3478 log.pkg=connections)
INF Joined relay (uri=relay://199.253.28.203:22067 log.pkg=relay/client)
```

Despite successful initial connection establishment, the instability between v2.x instances suggests ongoing connection maintenance issues.
## 4. Root Cause Analysis

### 4.1 Memory Tracking Issue
The extremely high memory usage values (near 18446744073709543424 bytes, which is ~18 Exabytes) suggest an integer overflow or signed/unsigned integer handling issue in the memory monitoring code specific to v2.x. This could be caused by:

1. A bug in the memory statistics collection where negative values are cast to unsigned integers
2. An issue with memory usage calculation that produces incorrect values
3. Problems with the memory monitoring system that incorrectly reports usage

This excessive memory reporting could be causing performance degradation and connection instability as the system attempts to apply throttling based on incorrect data.

### 4.2 HTTP/2 Protocol Issues
The malformed HTTP responses in crash reporting with HTTP/2 frame headers suggest incompatibilities with HTTP/2 protocol handling in v2.x. This might also affect other HTTP/2 connections between v2.x instances. The issue could be related to:

1. HTTP/2 client implementation changes in Go 1.25.1
2. Incompatibilities with the server-side HTTP/2 implementation
3. TLS configuration issues specific to HTTP/2

### 4.3 QUIC Connection Issues
While QUIC connections appear to be established, there may be stability issues in the QUIC implementation between v2.x versions that weren't present in v1.x. Potential issues include:

1. Connection keep-alive mechanism differences
2. QUIC version negotiation problems
3. Resource cleanup issues causing connection leaks
4. Packet loss detection and recovery differences

### 4.4 Filesystem Watcher Issues
The repeated failures to start the filesystem watcher on Android indicate that the inotify limits are being exceeded. This could be due to:

1. Inefficient inotify usage on Android platforms
2. Suboptimal buffer sizing for resource-constrained environments
3. Issues with the adaptive buffer management system

These failures could impact folder synchronization stability and contribute to connection instability as the system struggles to maintain consistent file monitoring.

### 4.5 NAT-PMP Issues
The "connection refused" errors in NAT-PMP port mapping suggest issues with the NAT-PMP implementation or router compatibility:

1. Timing issues in NAT-PMP requests
2. Router firmware incompatibilities with the NAT-PMP client implementation
3. Network configuration issues preventing proper communication with the gateway

These issues could prevent proper port mapping, affecting the device's ability to receive incoming connections and contributing to connection instability.

## 5. Technical Architecture

### 5.1 Connection Management System
Syncthing's connection management system handles:
- Multiple transport protocols (TCP, QUIC, Relay)
- Connection prioritization and failover
- NAT traversal (STUN, UPnP, NAT-PMP)
- Device discovery (local and global)
- Connection health monitoring and adaptive keep-alive

The system is implemented in `lib/connections/service.go` and supporting files.

### 5.2 Memory Management
The folder health monitoring system tracks:
- Memory usage per folder
- CPU usage per folder
- Throttling mechanisms when resource limits are exceeded

This system is implemented in `lib/model/folder_health_monitor.go`.

### 5.3 Protocol Handling
Syncthing uses several protocols:
- BEP (Block Exchange Protocol) for synchronization
- TLS for encryption
- HTTP/2 for some services
- QUIC for high-performance connections

Protocol handling is implemented across multiple packages including `lib/protocol/`, `lib/connections/`, and `lib/ur/`.

### 5.4 Filesystem Monitoring
Syncthing uses platform-specific filesystem monitoring implementations:
- inotify on Linux/Android
- FSEvents on macOS
- ReadDirectoryChangesW on Windows

Filesystem monitoring is implemented in `lib/fs/` with platform-specific optimizations.

### 5.5 NAT Traversal
Syncthing implements multiple NAT traversal mechanisms:
- STUN for NAT type detection and external address discovery
- UPnP for automatic port mapping
- NAT-PMP for port mapping on compatible routers
- Relay connections for devices behind restrictive NATs

NAT traversal is implemented in `lib/nat/` and `lib/stun/` packages.

## 9. Conclusion

The connection stability issues between Syncthing v2.x instances appear to be multifaceted, involving memory tracking problems, HTTP/2 protocol incompatibilities, QUIC implementation issues, filesystem monitoring limitations on Android, and NAT-PMP implementation problems. Addressing these issues will require a comprehensive approach that includes:

1. Fixing the core memory tracking issues that are causing excessive memory usage reports
2. Resolving HTTP/2 compatibility problems that affect crash reporting and potentially other connections
3. Improving QUIC connection stability between v2.x instances
4. Optimizing filesystem monitoring on Android to prevent inotify limit issues
5. Fixing NAT-PMP implementation to ensure proper port mapping

The implementation plan is structured in phases to address the most critical issues first (memory tracking and protocol compatibility) before moving on to platform-specific optimizations. This approach should help restore stability to v2.x to v2.x connections while maintaining compatibility with v1.x instances.
